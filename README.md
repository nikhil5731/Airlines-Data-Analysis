# Airline Profitability Analysis

## Overview

This project addresses the challenges faced by our airline company in light of stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, and increased labor costs. The primary objective is to identify opportunities that can increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit per seat and mitigating the impact of industry challenges.

## Business Problem

### 1. Stricter Environmental Regulations
The airline industry faces pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, resulting in higher operating costs and limited expansion opportunities.

### 2. Higher Flight Taxes
Governments worldwide impose heavier taxes on flights, increasing the cost of air travel and subsequently decreasing demand.

### 3. Tight Labor Market
A shortage of skilled professionals in the aviation sector has led to increased labor costs and higher turnover rates.

## Objectives

1. **Increase Occupancy Rate:** Elevate average profit per seat by identifying opportunities to enhance the occupancy rate on low-performing flights.

2. **Improve Pricing Strategy:** Develop a dynamic pricing strategy considering changing market conditions and aligning with customer preferences to attract and retain customers.

3. **Enhance Customer Experience:** Focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for customers, from booking to arrival, to differentiate our services in a highly competitive industry and increase customer loyalty.

## Key Insights

1. Analyzing revenue data like total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is crucial for airlines to maximize profitability.

2. By assessing these indicators, airlines can identify areas for improvement and make changes to their pricing and route plans.

3. A higher occupancy rate is important for profitability as it allows airlines to maximize revenue while minimizing costs related to empty seats.

4. Despite the "Economy" class having the highest number of bookings and generating significantly more revenue compared to the “Business” and “Comfort” class, the average revenue per booking is higher for the "Business" class compared to "Business" and "Comfort."

5. Identifying air routes with low occupancy rates enables airline companies to optimize costs, allocate resources effectively, enhance revenue, improve customer satisfaction, and make informed strategic decisions.

6. Airlines should review and adjust the prices for each aircraft, considering factors like condition and facilities, to ensure they are neither too cheap nor too expensive.

7. However, increasing occupancy rates should not compromise consumer happiness or safety.

8. Airlines need to find a balance between profit and delivering high-quality service while upholding safety regulations.

9. Adopting a data-driven strategy for revenue analysis and optimization can help airlines achieve long-term success in a competitive business.
